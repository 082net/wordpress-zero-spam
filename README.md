Tired of all the useless and bloated WordPress spam plugins? The WordPress Zero Spam plugin makes blocking spam a cinch without all the bloated options. <strong>Just install, activate and say goodbye to spam.</strong> Based on work by <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/wordpress-comment-spam" target="_blank">David Walsh</a>.

## Installation

1. Upload the `zero-spam` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

## How It Works

Most spambots will crawl a form, enter a value for all fields, then submit the form. This plugin blocks those spambots by adding a hidden field via JS when the comment form is submitted. If a spambot enters a value for that hidden field, the comment is blocked.
